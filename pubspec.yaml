  Support for basic Dart code generation from Altova UML Model.  The idea is UML
  can be used to define the structure of data being passed between
  client/server. Once stored in UML the XMI data can be parsed and used to
  generate Dart code. Since Dart does not yet have an XML parser, the approach is
  to pass the model through a XML to JSON converter (_xmi_to_json.rb_) first. 

  
  Only a subset of the XMI meta data is defined - just enough to support basic
  classes with properties. Meta data for templates are required for two uml
  parameterized classes (list<E> and j_map<K>). This particular solution requires
  all class names in the UML to be lower case with underscore separating
  words. The reason for this is that the ebisu code generation itself is strict
  about that as well.
